## üè† Take-home points:
- Henry Bragg and his son Lawrence Bragg invented X-ray crystallography, pioneering the use of X-ray diffraction to determine the atomic structure of crystals.

- The first studies by Henry Bragg and his son Lawrence Bragg were conducted on simple inorganic salt crystals such as sodium chloride

- Lawrence Bragg went on to focus on the structures of organic compounds and was the first to determine the low-resolution structure of hemoglobin, revealing the structural differnece of deoxy- and oxy-states.

- Bragg‚Äôs PhD student, Max Perutz, focused on solving the phase problem and determined the high-resolution structure of hemoglobin using the method of isomorphous replacement.

- John Kendrew, a student of both Bragg and Perutz, focused on determining the structure of myoglobin and, together with Perutz, revealed the structural differences between fetal and adult hemoglobin.

- Dorothy Hodgkin identified the structures of key biomolecules essential for life, such as penicillin, vitamin B12, and insulin.

- One of the secrets to their laboratory‚Äôs success was its happy and supportive research atmosphere.

## Summary
Henry Bragg and his son Lawrence Bragg laid the foundations of X-ray crystallography, which was further advanced by their student Max Perutz and, in turn, by John Kendrew, who studied under both Bragg and Perutz. Dorothy Hodgkin, who also worked with Bragg, contributed significantly to the field as well. Together, these physicists were pioneers of structural biology and X-ray crystallography, and their discoveries fueled the development of related fields such as biochemistry and molecular biology. For the first time, these scientists considered proteins in three-dimensional space. They also proved that a supportive and collaborative research environment is fundamental to scientific progress.
