## üè† Take-home points

- Protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction problem is the challenge of predicting whether and how two proteins interact, often from sequence or structural information, given the complexity and variability of biological interfaces.

- Rigid-body docking assumes proteins remain structurally rigid and searches for the best geometric and physicochemical fit between their surfaces.

- Flexible-docking allows conformational changes, typically in side chains or loops, to better capture realistic protein‚Äìprotein interactions.

- Ensemble-docking uses multiple conformations of proteins (from experiments or simulations) to account for structural flexibility during docking.

- Machine learning approaches learn interaction patterns directly from large datasets of protein sequences and structures, enabling end-to-end prediction of binding likelihoods and interfaces.

## Summary

In this section, we will discuss various protein‚Äìprotein docking methods, their theoretical foundations, and applications. Protein‚Äìprotein docking is a computational strategy used to predict the structures of protein complexes from known subunits and represents an upper-level challenge built on protein structure prediction. The field has evolved over several decades, beginning with rigid-body docking in the 1970s‚Äì1980s, which relied on surface complementarity, advancing to scoring-based and flexible docking in the 1990s‚Äì2000s to account for side-chain and backbone motions, and later to ensemble docking, which incorporates conformational variability. Most recently, deep learning‚Äìbased methods such as AlphaFold-Multimer have achieved unprecedented accuracy by leveraging large-scale sequence and structure datasets.
