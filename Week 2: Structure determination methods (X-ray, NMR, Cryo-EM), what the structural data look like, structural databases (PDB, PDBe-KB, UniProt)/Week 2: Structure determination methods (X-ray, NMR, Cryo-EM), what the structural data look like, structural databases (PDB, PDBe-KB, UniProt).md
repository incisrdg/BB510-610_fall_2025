## üè† Take-home points

- Most structural data are obtained through the following three methods: X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.

- X-ray crystallography can resolve structures at atomic resolution, however, due to crystal packing effects, the resulting structures may deviate from their native folds. 

- Cryo-EM allows the visualization of large macromolecular complexes in near-native conditions, moreover, it is particularly well-suited for studying membrane proteins.

- NMR spectroscopy provides structural information in solution, closely resembling the physiological environment, however, it is generally limited to smaller proteins due to signal overlap and sensitivity constraints. It is also one of the most labor-intensive methods for determining protein structures.

- The Protein Data Bank (PDB), which was established in 1971, is a structural database that houses experimentally determined protein structures obtained through X-ray, Cryo-EM and NMR together with some computational models.

- The primary file formats used for representing protein structures are the PDB format (.pdb) and the mmCIF format (.cif). PDB format is the traditional flat-text representation, while mmCIF is a more modern and flexible format designed to accommodate larger and more complex information.

- UniProt is a comprehensive database of both protein sequence/structure and functional information.

## Summary

This week's lecture is the only one dedicated to discussing the experimental methods and theoretical foundations of these protein structure determination methods. Although this course primarily focuses on computational structural biology, it is important to understand where the data come from and how it is collected. If you have a wet lab background, I am sure you will enjoy gaining a structural perspective. If you are a dry lab person like me, do not worry, I strongly believe you will still gain valuable insights into structure determination methods and appreciate the elegance of some fascinating physical and chemical experiments running behind structural data collection. We will discuss three fundamental methods for protein structure determination: X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In addition to covering some theoretical insights, the main focus will be on comparing these methods in terms of their ability to capture different kinds of structural data. Keep in mind that each method has its own limitations and may fail to resolve certain types of structures. For the purposes of computational structural biology, it is essential to understand which types of structural data available in databases best align with your research hypothesis.

## Protein symmetry

- Symmetry operations in proteins are important because they let nature build large, stable, and functional complexes efficiently, even if this is not the main focus of the course. It is still useful to get familiar with the different sources of symmetry in protein structures, since they often underlie assembly, stability, and function.
