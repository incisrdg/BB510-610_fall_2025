## 🏠 Take-home Points

- AlphaFold provides several confidence metrics such as pLDDT, ipLDDT, PAE, iPAE, pTM, and ipTM to help assess the quality and reliability of its accuracy of protein structures.

- The pLDDT score provides local (per-residue) confidence, reflecting the accuracy of predicted secondary structures, while ipLDDT offers an analogous measure for interface regions.

          - pLDDT>90: very high
          - 70<pLDDT<90: confident
          - 50<pLDDT<70: low
          - pLDDT<50: very low
  

- The PAE (Predicted Aligned Error) score, a continuous metric, reflects the confidence in the relative positioning between pairs of residues (with iPAE used for interface regions). It is particularly informative for domain–domain positioning, multimer interface orientation, flexible or hinge regions.

- The pTM (predicted TM-score) provides an estimate of the global structural accuracy of a predicted model, evaluating the correctness of the overall protein fold .
  
          - pTM>0.5: similar fold
          - pTM<0.5: wrong fold

## Summary
Deep learning methods such as AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold have dramatically advanced ability to predict the structures of proteins and protein–protein complexes. However, accurately evaluating the confidence and accuracy of these predictions is equally important, especially for guiding experimental validation or downstream applications like drug design and variant analysis. Confidence metrics such as pLDDT and PAE, generated by the models themselves, provide residue-level and inter-residue/inter-domain error estimates. For protein complexes, additional scores like the predicted TM-score (pTM), interface predicted TM-score (ipTM) help assess global and interface-specific accuracy. Therefore, thorough assessment of both global and local predicted structural motifs is critical for accurately interpreting and validating deep learning–based structural predictions. This is one of the most important sections of the course, and it is crucial to develop a fundamental understanding of these confidence scores. Do not worry, we will discuss them extensively and work through various cases to become familiar with their use and implementation. Despite its importance and the effort it takes to understand, I believe this is the most enjoyable week of the course! 🥳
