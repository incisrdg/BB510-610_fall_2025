## üè† Take-home Points

- AlphaFold provides several confidence metrics such as pLDDT, ipLDDT, PAE, iPAE, pTM, and ipTM to help assess the quality and reliability of its predicted protein structures.

- The pLDDT focuses on local (per-residue) confidence, which typically reflects how well AlphaFold is predicting secondary structure elements and local geometry. (ipLDDT is for the interface)

- The PAE (Predicted Aligned Error) focuses on the confidence of the relative position between pairs of residues, and is particularly informative for:
      Domain‚Äìdomain positioning 
      Multimer interface orientation 
      Flexible or hinge regions 

## Summary
Deep learning methods such as AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold have dramatically advanced our ability to predict the structures of proteins and protein‚Äìprotein complexes. However, accurately evaluating the confidence and reliability of these predictions is equally important, especially for guiding experimental validation or downstream applications like drug design and mutation analysis. Confidence metrics such as pLDDT and PAE, which are generated by the models themselves, provide residue-level and inter-residue error estimates. For protein complexes, additional scores like the predicted TM-score (pTM), interface predicted TM-score (ipTM) help assess global and interface-specific accuracy. Thus, rigorous evaluation of both global fold and local interfaces is essential for interpreting and trusting deep learning-based structural predictions.
