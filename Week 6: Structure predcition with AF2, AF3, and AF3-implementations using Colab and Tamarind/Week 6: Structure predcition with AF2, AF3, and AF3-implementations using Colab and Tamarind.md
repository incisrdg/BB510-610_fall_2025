## üö® Attention: pre-course action

In this section, we will perform protein structure predictions using ColabFold (for AF2), the AF3 server, and the Tamarinde Bio server (for Boltz-2 and Chai-1). Please create accounts for the servers in advance of the session by using the links provided on the README page.

‚ùóÔ∏è You are also expected to select a human protein, preferably a monomer or dimer, and extract its FASTA sequence from the PDB or UniProt. Please avoid larger assemblies to save time.

ü§ì Here are some suggestions: 

- IL37 and IL18RŒ±

- PDB ID: 7x2l

- Human Nars1 protein

## üè† Take-home points

- Adding lipids can help support the correct orientation of membrane-embedded proteins.

- Adding salts can help proteins fold into the native conformation.

- Natural ligands can provide structural information that guides the positioning of specific ligand backbones.

- Be aware of hallucinations when predicting structures of larger protein sequences.

- Multiple copies may superimpose during the prediction of higher-order oligomeric assemblies.

- 1/20 seeds got confident prediction scores.

## Summary

This section focuses on structure predictions using four different methods: AF2, AF3, Boltz-2,
and Chai-1. The goal is to evaluate how various parameters such as model type, number of recycles, number of seeds, presence of ions, presence of lipids, and the introduction of pocket and contact restraints affect the prediction outcomes. We will also discuss practical hacks and warnings to consider during protein structure prediction.
