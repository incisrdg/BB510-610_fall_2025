## üö® Attention

In this section, we will perform protein structure predictions using ColabFold (for AF2), the AF3 server, and the Tamarinde Bio server (for Boltz-2 and Chai-1). Please create accounts for the servers in advance of the session by using the links provided on the README page.

## üè† Take-home points



## Summary

This section focuses on structure predictions using four different methods: AF2, AF3, Boltz-2,
and Chai-1. The goal is to evaluate how various parameters such as model type, number of recycles, number of seeds, presence of ions, presence of lipids, and the introduction of pocket and contact restraints affect the prediction outcomes. We will also discuss practical hacks and warnings to consider during protein structure prediction.
