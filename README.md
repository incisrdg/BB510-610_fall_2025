# Structural_Biology
🙌 Welcome to the structural biology course! 🧬 This course is all about protein structures. We will cover topics including, but not limited to, the history of structural biology, structural data and sources, and the protein structure prediction problem from scratch to today's complexity. You can find all the relevant course materials here 📚. The field is evolving at the speed of the light ⚡️. Let's try to keep up with as many advancements as we can.

## 👀 Here is an overview of the next 14 weeks:

 Week 1: Course overview and history of the structural biology. 
 
 Week 2: Structure determination methods (X-ray, NMR, Cryo-EM), what the structural data look like, structural databases (PDB, PDBe-KB, UniProt).

 Week 3: Protein folding problem, CASP and CAPRI competitions, AlphaFold and RosettaFold as the leading teams.
 
 Week 4: Evaluation of AlphaFold predicted models.  ***(report I)*** 📝 -10 pts
 
 Week 5: Architecture of AF2, AF3, and AF3-implementations. 
 
 Week 6: Structure prediction with AF2, AF3, and AF3-implementations using Colab and Tamarind. 💻 ***(workshop session I + report II)*** 📝 -20 pts
 
 Week 7: Pathogenicity prediction using structural data (single mutants: DynaMut, PremPS, FoldX, double mutants: ThermoMPNN-D) 💻 ***(workshop session II-I)***  -10 pts
 
 Week 8: Pathogenicity prediction with AlphaMissense and Hotspot. 💻 ***(workshop session II-II + report III)*** 📝
 
 Week 9: Protein-protein docking (rigid-body docking: ClusPro, flexible docking: HADDOCK) and binding affinity calculations (PRODIGY, Boltz-2). 💻 ***(workshop session III + report IV)*** 📝
 
 Week 10: Molecular docking pipeline: module 1 (Digital Representations of Molecules) and module 2 (Exploring Chemical and Biological Data With BidingDB and the RDKit). 
 
 Week 11: Molecular docking pipeline: module 3 (Preparing Structures for Docking) and module 4 (Molecular Docking using gnina).
 
 Week 12: Conformation prediction with BioEmu. ***(workshop session IV + report V)*** 📝
 
 Week 13: De novo protein design with RFDiffusion by Rosetta team.
 
 Week 14: Q&A and discussion session. 🙋‍♀️




❗️ You can access the materials and required information for each week in the corresponding section. You are kindly requested to review materials before coming to class. Please check them regularly to keep up with the updates. ❗️


## ⬇️ Below are some general requirements/suggestions for this course:

✅ For structure visualization as well as some basic calculations, please set up UCSF ChimeraX and/or VMD from the following links.

UCSF ChimeraX: https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/download.html
VMD: https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD

✅ For additional basic calculations, it is recommended that you use Jupyter🪐 or Spyder🕸️. To access these environments, you can install either Anaconda or Miniconda. Once you have installed Anaconda, you can copy the repositories into Jupyter to work on the provided scripts. This will be required in weeks 10 and 11 for molecular docking modules.

Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download
Miniconda: https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install

✅ Please sign up for Colab with your Google account. You will need Colab to run structure predictions using AF2, AF3-implementations, and BioEmu. Colab can also be used to run scripts in weeks 10 and 11.

ColabFold: https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb

AF3 server: https://alphafoldserver.com/

Tamarind Bio: https://app.tamarind.bio/app

Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/

## Pop-up quizzes 
🔮 There will be pop-up quizzes during the first five minutes of select lessons, not for grading, but to help recall the key points from the previous week. Highly recommend you join the pop-up quizzes, they will be fun!

🍀 Pop-up quizzes are a fun way to collect some extra points in this course.

## Workshops and reports 

There will be workshop sessions in the second half of select lessons, including weeks 6, 7, 8, 9 and 12. During the class hours, you are expected to work on the given problems and begin writing your reports. Do not worry if you are not able to finish your reports during class hours, you will have time until the end of the day to send them to my email.  Please do not forget to bring your computers to the workshop sessions! 💻

❗️ These workshops and reports are the main actions through which you will be graded for this course. There is no MT or final exam, so please pay attention to your reports.

📝 A report template will be provided to guide you in the first writing process, however, there will be no templates for the following weeks.

📎 If you are an MSc or PhD student working on a specific protein or proteins, you may use your own protein for the workshop sessions. This will allow you to analyze your protein on a protein-sstructure level, providing insights that can guide your thesis work. 

Just a friendly reminder: Since I am working in the computational field, I have tools that can easily detect AI-generated text, and I am also quite familiar with the language of different AI models such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. Please avoid using AI to write your reports. You are not expected to produce huge paragraphs, instead, focus on explaining your results briefly and providing thoughtful discussions about them. That’s the main purpose of science, after all! 👩‍🔬
