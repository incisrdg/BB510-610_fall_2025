# Structural_Biology
Welcome to the structural biology courseüß¨! This course is all about protein structures. We will cover topics including, but not limited to, the history of structural biology, structural data and sources, and the protein structure prediction problem. You can find all the relevant course materials hereüìö. The field is evolving at the speed of the light‚ö°Ô∏è. Let's try to keep up with as many advancements as we can.

Here is an overview of the next 14 weeks:

Week 1: Course overview and history of the structural biology.
Week 2: Structure determination methods (X-ray, NMR, Cryo-EM), what the structural data look like, structural databases (PDB, PDBe-KB, UniProt)
Week 3: Protein folding problem, CASP and CAPRI competitions, AlphaFold as a groundbreaking team.
Week 4: Evaluation of AlphaFold predicted models.
Week 5: Architecture of AF2, AF3, and AF3-implementations. 
Week 6: Structure predcition with AF2, AF3, and AF3-implementations.
