# Structural_Biology
Welcome to the structural biology course! üß¨ This course is all about protein structures. We will cover topics including, but not limited to, the history of structural biology, structural data and sources, and the protein structure prediction problem from scratch to today's complexity. You can find all the relevant course materials here üìö. The field is evolving at the speed of the light ‚ö°Ô∏è. Let's try to keep up with as many advancements as we can.

## üëÄHere is an overview of the next 14 weeks:

 Week 1: Course overview and history of the structural biology. 
 
 Week 2: Structure determination methods (X-ray, NMR, Cryo-EM), what the structural data look like, structural databases (PDB, PDBe-KB, UniProt).

 Week 3: Protein folding problem, CASP and CAPRI competitions, AlphaFold and RosettaFold as the leader teams.
 
 Week 4: Evaluation of AlphaFold predicted models.
 
 Week 5: Architecture of AF2, AF3, and AF3-implementations. 
 
 Week 6: Structure predcition with AF2, AF3, and AF3-implementations using Colab and Tamarind. 
 
 Week 7: Pathogenicity prediction using structural data (single mutant: DynaMut, PremPS, FoldX, double mutant: ThermoMPNN-D)
 
 Week 8: Pathogenicity prediction with AlphaMissense and Hotspot.
 
 Week 9: Protein-protein docking (rigid-body docking: ClusPro, flexible docking: HADDOCK) and binding affinity calculations (PRODIGY, Boltz-2).
 
 Week 10: Molecular docking pipeline: module 1 (Digital Representations of Molecules) and module 2 (Exploring Chemical and Biological Data With BidingDB and the RDKit).
 
 Week 11: Molecular docking pipeline: module 3 (Preparing Structures for Docking) and module 4 (Molecular Docking using gnina).
 
 Week 12: Conformation prediction with BioEmu.
 
 Week 13: De novo protein design with RFDiffusion by Rosetta team.
 
 Week 14: Q&A and discussion session. 




‚ùïYou can access the materials and required information for each week in the corresponding section. You are kindly requested to review materials before coming to class.‚ùï


## ‚¨áÔ∏è Below are some general suggestions for this course:

‚úÖ For structure visualization as well as some basic calculations, please set up UCSF ChimeraX and VMD from the following links.

UCSF ChimeraX: https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/download.html
VMD: https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD

‚úÖ For additional basic calculations, it is recommended that you use Jupyterü™ê or Spyderüï∏Ô∏è. To access these environments, you can install either Anaconda or Miniconda. Once you have installed Anaconda, you can copy the repositories into Jupyter to work on the provided scripts. This will be required in weeks 10 and 11 for molecular docking modules.

Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download
Miniconda: https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install

‚úÖ Please sign up for Colab with your Google account. You will need Colab to run structure predictions using AF2, AF3 implementations, and BioEmu. Colab can also be used to run scripts in weeks 10 and 11 (suggested).

ColabFold: https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb

AF3 server: https://alphafoldserver.com/

Tamarind Bio: https://app.tamarind.bio/app

Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/

##
üîÆ There will be pop-up quizzes during the first five minutes of each lesson, not for grading, but to help recall the key points from the previous week. Highly recommend you join the pop-up quizzes, they will be fun!

üçÄ Pop-up quizzes are a fun way to collect some extra points in this course.

(There will be no pop-up quizzes in the first two weeks!)

## üìù Workshops and reports 

üíª There will be workshop sessions in the second half of the lessons during certain weeks, including weeks 6, 7, and 8. During the class hours, you are expected to work on the given problems and begin writing your reports. Do not worry if you are unable to finish your reports during class hours, you will have until the end of the day to send them to my email. (Please do not forget to bring your computers to the workshop sessions!)



‚ùóÔ∏è These workshops and reports are the main actions through which you will earn points for this course. There is no MT or final exam, so please pay attention to your reports.

üìå A report template will be provided to guide you in the first writing process, however, there will be no templates for the following weeks.
