# Structural_Biology
Welcome to the structural biology course üß¨! This course is all about protein structures. We will cover topics including, but not limited to, the history of structural biology, structural data and sources, and the protein structure prediction problem. You can find all the relevant course materials here üìö. The field is evolving at the speed of the light ‚ö°Ô∏è. Let's try to keep up with as many advancements as we can.

üëÄHere is an overview of the next 14 weeks:

 Week 1: Course overview and history of the structural biology. 
 
 Week 2: Structure determination methods (X-ray, NMR, Cryo-EM), what the structural data look like, structural databases (PDB, PDBe-KB, UniProt).

 Week 3: Protein folding problem, CASP and CAPRI competitions, AlphaFold and RosettaFold as groundbreaking teams.
 
 Week 4: Evaluation of AlphaFold predicted models.
 
 Week 5: Architecture of AF2, AF3, and AF3-implementations. 
 
 Week 6: Structure predcition with AF2, AF3, and AF3-implementations using Colab and Tamarind. 

üì¢ Announcement of project topics!
 
 Week 7: Pathogenicity prediction using structural data (single mutant: DynaMut, PremPS, FoldX, double mutant: ThermoMPNN-D)
 
 Week 8: Pathogenicity prediction with AlphaMissense and Hotspot.
 
 Week 9: Protein-protein docking (rigid-body docking: ClusPro, flexible docking: HADDOCK) and binding affinity calculations (PRODIGY).
 
 Week 10: Molecular docking pipeline: module 1 (Digital Representations of Molecules) and module 2 (Exploring Chemical and Biological Data With BidingDB and the RDKit).
 
 Week 11: Molecular docking pipeline: module 3 (Preparing Structures for Docking) and module 4 (Molecular Docking using gnina).
 
 Week 12: Conformation prediction with BioEmu.
 
 Week 13: De novo protein design with RFDiffusion by Rosetta team.
 
 Week 14: Project presentations.
