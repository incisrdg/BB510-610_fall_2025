## üè† Take-home points

Most structural data are obtained through the following three methods: X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.

X-ray crystallography can resolve structures at atomic resolution; however, due to crystal packing effects, the resulting structures may deviate from their native folds. 

Cryo-EM allows the visualization of large macromolecular complexes in near-native conditions; moreover, it is particularly well-suited for studying membrane proteins.

NMR spectroscopy provides structural information in solution, closely resembling the physiological environment; however, it is generally limited to smaller proteins due to signal overlap and sensitivity constraints. It is also one of the most labor-intensive methods for determining protein structures.



## Summary

This week's lecture is the only one dedicated to discussing the experimental methods and theoretical foundations of these protein structure determination methods. Although this course primarily focuses on computational structural biology, it is important to understand where the data come from and how it is obtained. If you have a wet lab background, I am sure you will enjoy gaining a structural perspective. If you are a dry lab person like me, do not worry, I strongly believe you will still gain valuable insights into structure determination methods and appreciate the elegance of some fascinating physical and chemical experiments running behind structural data collection. We will discuss three fundamental methods for protein structure characterization: X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In addition to covering some theoretical insights, the main focus will be on comparing these methods in terms of their ability to capture different types of structural data. Keep in mind that each method has its own limitations and may fail to resolve certain types of structures. For the purposes of computational structural biology, it is essential to understand which types of structural data available in databases best align with your research hypothesis.
