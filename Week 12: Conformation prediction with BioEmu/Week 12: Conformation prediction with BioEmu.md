## üè† Take-home points

- BioEmu generates protein ensembles, not a single static structure, providing rapid insights into conformational diversity and stability shifts that are critical for understanding protein function.

- It learns an energy-based scoring function to approximate the Boltzmann distribution of protein conformations, enabling accurate sampling of equilibrium ensembles.

- It selects structures from the learned distribution and refines them through diffusion to produce realistic conformational states much faster than MD. 

## Summary
So far, we have discussed various protein structure prediction methods. However, understanding a protein‚Äôs function often requires more than a single static structure. BioEmu is a generative AI model that rapidly produces accurate structural ensembles, achieving results comparable to long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations but within hours on a single GPU. Trained on AlphaFold structures, MD trajectories, and experimental stability measurements, it captures conformational diversity and stability shifts that are valuable for drug design and protein engineering.
