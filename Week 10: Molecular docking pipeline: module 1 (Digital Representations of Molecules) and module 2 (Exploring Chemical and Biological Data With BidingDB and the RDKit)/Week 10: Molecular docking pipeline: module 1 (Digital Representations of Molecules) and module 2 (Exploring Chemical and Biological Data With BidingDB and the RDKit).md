## üìù Take-home work (The deadline is 12:00 a.m. on the same day) (5 pts)

Try to guess each molecule from its SMILES. Please report the name of each molecule and try to draw the chemical structure. (2 pts)

1) Oc1ccccc1 (0.40 pts)
2) c1ncc[nH]1 (0.40 pts)
3) NC(=O)N (0.40 pts)
4) CN1C=NC2=C1N(C(=O)N(C)C2=O)C (0.40 pts)
5) NCCC(=O)O (0.40 pts)

- Please report all the outputs and figures from the second notebook and briefly explain the results. What does the final dataset represent, and how and why did we curate it? (3 pts)


## Workshop

In this workshop section, we will use the first two notebooks created by The Molecular Sciences Software Institute. This repository contains notebooks for the workshop Python for Cheminformatics-Driven Molecular Docking held on May 1, 2025 in collaboration with the RCSB Protein Data Bank.

The notebooks for this workshop were designed to work with Google Colab. Open the notebooks in Colab by clicking the links below.
