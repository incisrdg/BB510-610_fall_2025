## üè† Take-home points 

- Unlike AF2 and AF3, RFdiffusion is not a predictor but a generative model that can design de novo protein structures.

- It uses denoising diffusion probabilistic models, progressively transforming random noise into realistic and stable protein backbones.

- The model can be guided to design conditioned proteins desired features such as catalytic sites, binding pockets, or symmetric assemblies.

- It enables exploration of structural space beyond evolution, producing entirely new folds and architectures not observed in natural proteins.

## Summary 

In this section, we will talk about the foundations and applications of RFdiffusion, a cutting-edge deep learning framework for de novo protein design. Leveraging the power of denoising diffusion probabilistic models, RFdiffusion generates intricate three-dimensional protein structures by iteratively refining noisy representations into realistic, physically stable backbones. Built upon the RoseTTAFold architecture, it transcends the predictive capabilities of models such as AlphaFold by functioning as a truly generative system, capable of being guided to produce proteins with tailored attributes‚Äîincluding binding pockets, catalytic motifs, and complex symmetric assemblies. This versatility positions RFdiffusion as a groundbreaking tool in enzyme engineering, therapeutic design, and nanotechnology, while also opening unprecedented avenues for exploring entirely novel protein folds beyond the limits of natural evolution.
